        I am much more aware of the network infrastructure around me. It is easy
        to simply walk past manhole covers and street markings without caring as
        we go about our day-to-day. I would argue that most people do this. This
        book, however, inspires us to ask questions and be curious about the
        things that seem mundane at times as they can be really interesting.

        The Internet deep deep down is a bunch of cables, and this article was a
        great reminder of what infrastructure is actually needed to keep the
        Internet going. The Internet also seems so disconnected from the
        physical world, but it can suffer from its environment if not taken care
        of properly. For instance, if these cables were not underground, they
        could be impacted by weather and the like, which would greatly affect
        the way we live life.

        I've mostly just considered it as a space online, like a
        remote/imaginary internet land. I've never given any substantial thought
        to the physicality of the internet, and it still weirds me out to think
        about those long undersea internet cables actually existing in the
        ocean... I really liked the underground portion of the book, especially
        the little drawings that would go with it. Almost like learning a new
        language/symbols--it was especially fun to look at some of the signs on
        the field trip too. It was so interesting that all the markings on the
        streets that I previously would've simply walk pass were a set of
        symbols and in some ways internet language.

        To be honest, I never really think too much about how the Internet
        works, which looking back makes me upset that I didn't have that
        curiosity--how could I not want to know? I guess because it's been
        around since before I was born, I take it so much for granted that I
        just never really wonder about it. It's like wondering why birds have
        feathers, or something like that. I guess I never really think of the
        Internet as a physical thing. It's all just those dotted lines
        connecting circles and clouds to me. I had no clue we were walking on
        top of text messages and video calls and transactions and the like. It's
        right beneath us! The part about the street markings was probably my
        favorite. I never really thought about what they meant, I more thought
        that they were guidance for construction itself. Now that I know they
        mark where fiber optic cables and the like are, I feel like I'll be so
        excited to see them. They're like Easter eggs, or a secret map. When you
        know what they are, they mean so much more.

        I, probably like most people, was completely unaware of how many of
        these markings were even related to the internet. I thought, for
        example, mancovers were only to access sewer or drainage tunnels. With
        that being said, I have noticed various markings mentioned in the text
        when walking around campus. I always knew internet was physical (to a
        degree), but after reading the text, it is much more physical than I
        realized. Now, however, the internet seems more fragile; it seems much
        more likely that there can be physical failures from human causes
        although I realize one line being disrupted does not destroy the whole
        system.

        How little we know about the internet's physical side is pretty crazy.
        We're online consistently, and we don't realize all that's happening in
        the background that makes it all possible.

        The beginning of Networks of New York where Burrington speaks about the
        veil which seems to cover the technicalities of the internet reminded me
        of how when I was younger I thought that my classmates who could code,
        and were working on things like bread boards or raspberry pi (in middle
        school) were geniuses. In middle school, I was watching Youtube and
        playing Mall World on Facebook...So compared to what I was exposed
        to/knew about, my classmates seemed to be do doing things that were
        worlds away. But, as I learned these seemingly impossibly complex things
        myself, I'd come to realize that it's not so exclusive/reserved for the
        gifted. I think how I felt about my classmates projects is how many
        people might think of the internet. There's a thin layer of surface
        knowledge, and some sort of self-doubt that makes people hesitate to
        want to know more. I like the introduction of the internet as something
        physical (massive networks of optic cables) because I think it helps
        bridge the gap that exists for so many people in their understanding of
        the internet. It seems like tangibles are easier to understand than the
        theoretical and/or detached.

        Although varied in their content, the underlying theme across all of
        these pieces is the relationship between creation and connection.
        Whether it is physical art, a creative project, or something
        technological, humans show their love for and communicate with each
        other through the things that they create. And community, which is vital
        to all humans, evolves with people, and it is something that is found in
        different ways in the past, the present, and the future.

        I related much to the responses when asked what the Internet is, almost
        as if it is a mystical, esoteric domain reserved for experts.
        <br />
        What is service? Is it an act or an abstract ideal? Is it a practical
        consideration or an esoteric high-brow concept? Oxford Languages defines
        service as “the action of helping or doing work for someone.” Is it so
        vague that encompassing that any attempt to define if would be
        meaningless? To that, I say experimentation is more important than
        theory (or definition) creation in daily human life. To be sure, it is
        vital to have rough working definitions of “service” to provide us with
        rough templates of our objectives and what questions to ask. However,
        the application of definitions to experimenting on the canvas of the
        human condition is what truly gives “service” its meaning. Whether that
        is a developer working on Wikipedia, or an artist working with
        voicemails, or a stone engraver working with families of the deceased,
        each artist brings a unique conception of what it means to serve.

        I think a person can be their “best self” on the internet if she utilizes it to gain useful knowledge about topics that she is passionate about. I think the openness of the web comes with many implications. Because anyone can build a website or write a blog, misinformation is rampant. At the same time, the web is a place where various people can connect with one another. I think people should make an effort to decrease misinformation and increase genuine connections on the web.
