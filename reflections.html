        I am much more aware of the network infrastructure around me. It is easy to simply walk past manhole covers and street markings without caring as we go about our day-to-day. I would argue that most people do this. This book, however, inspires us to ask questions and be curious about the things that seem mundane at times as they can be really interesting.

        The Internet deep deep down is a bunch of cables, and this article was a great reminder of what infrastructure is actually needed to keep the Internet going. The Internet also seems so disconnected from the physical world, but it can suffer from its environment if not taken care of properly. For instance, if these cables were not underground, they could be impacted by weather and the like, which would greatly affect the way we live life.

       I've mostly just considered it as a space online, like a remote/imaginary internet land. I've never given any substantial thought to the physicality of the internet, and it still weirds me out to think about those long undersea internet cables actually existing in the ocean...

I really liked the underground portion of the book, especially the little drawings that would go with it. Almost like learning a new language/symbols--it was especially fun to look at some of the signs on the field trip too. It was so interesting that all the markings on the streets that I previously would've simply walk pass were a set of symbols and in some ways internet language.

        To be honest, I never really think too much about how the Internet works, which looking back makes me upset that I didn't have that curiosity--how could I not want to know? I guess because it's been around since before I was born, I take it so much for granted that I just never really wonder about it. It's like wondering why birds have feathers, or something like that. Back to the reading, though, when the author asked people how they saw the internet, I probably would've answered similarly to the first couple people. It's such an abstract concept to me -- it just is. I ended up loving this reading because it got me curious and taught me more about how the internet really is.

I guess I never really think of the Internet as a physical thing. It's all just those dotted lines connecting circles and clouds to me. But this reading shocked me in the striking physicality of the internet. I had no clue we were walking on top of text messages and video calls and transactions and the like. It's right beneath us! The part about the street markings was probably my favorite. I never really thought about what they meant, I more thought that they were guidance for construction itself. Now that I know they mark where fiber optic cables and the like are, I feel like I'll be so excited to see them. They're like Easter eggs, or a secret map. When you know what they are, they mean so much more. I also love the casualness of them - the scribbled handwriting in spray paint that fades over time. It really feels like a video game to me or something.
