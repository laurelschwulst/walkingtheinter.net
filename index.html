      <blockquote>"How do you see the Internet?"</blockquote>
      <p>
        Over the past two years, I've asked a lot of people this question. It's
        a question often met with confusion or requests for clarification. Do I
        mean "What do you think about the Internet, like in the grand scheme of
        things?" or

        Really, I'm asking all three.

        Sometimes it helps to start with that last question: how people access
        or use the Internet. For most people, the answer is that they see the
        Internet through screens browsers and apps on laptops and phones.
        Sometimes people will point at a router, vaguely understanding that's
        the device their Wi-Fi connection comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I understand the specifics of how someone interfaces with the
        Internet, I'll ask the second question: "How do you think the Internet
        works, and how do you visualize that process?" At this, answers vary,
        though they tend to follow three common trajectories, each one aligning
        well to certain tropes seen in stock photos and illustrations sometimes
        used to describe "the Internet."

      <blockquote>“I have no idea, maybe black magic.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        This answer sometimes involves hand-waving and anx-ious, slightly
        apologetic faces. To be fair, there are a lot of bad stock images out
        there that support that answer-which is to say, they make the mechanisms
        of the Internet appear impossibly complicated and opaque. You may have
        seen these sorts of images. Sometimes it's a man at the peak of an
        over-Photoshopped mountain, his arms reaching for a giant laptop in the
        sky from which fluffy white clouds emerge. Other times, it's a different
        man (always men in these weird dreamscapes, usually wearing ties), hands
        cradling poorly rendered collages of computers and a globe floating in
        some ethereal mist that could be data traveling across the network-or
        could be fairies, no one really knows.

      <p>
        Ironically, some of these baffling images emerge from attempts to make
        the Internet seem less complicated, through metaphors like "the cloud."
        Metaphors can be useful teaching tools, but when all that people know
        about the Internet are metaphors, it tends to make their understanding
        of it more clouded, not less.

      Our class, <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/conversations/">Graphic Design: Conversations</a>, we explored these themes to make sense of the internet. Each week, we came together to explore connectivity and creativity across the virtual and physical world. Through our walk, we hope to connect New York and Princeton to eachother, the internet, and the rest of the world, to help you think about the question,

        I am much more aware of the network infrastructure around me. It is easy to simply walk past manhole covers and street markings without caring as we go about our day-to-day. I would argue that most people do this. This book, however, inspires us to ask questions and be curious about the things that seem mundane at times as they can be really interesting.
