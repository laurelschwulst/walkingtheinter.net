        <blockquote>"How do you see the Internet?"</blockquote>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, I've asked a lot of people this question.
          It's a question often met with confusion or requests for
          clarification. Do I mean "What do you think about the Internet, like
          in the grand scheme of things?" or
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >"How do you think the Internet works?"</a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_emarketing-the-essential-guide-to-online-marketing/s04-04-how-do-people-access-the-inter.html"
            target="_blank"
            >"How do you access the Internet?"</a
          >
          Really, I'm asking all three.

          />

        <p>
          Sometimes it helps to start with that last question: how people access
          or use the Internet. For most people, the answer is that they see the
          Internet through screens browsers and apps on laptops and phones.
          Sometimes people will point at a router, vaguely understanding that's
          the device their Wi-Fi connection comes from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I understand the specifics of how someone interfaces with the
          Internet, I'll ask the second question: "How do you think the Internet
          works, and how do you visualize that process?" At this, answers vary,
          though they tend to follow three common trajectories, each one
          aligning well to certain tropes seen in stock photos and illustrations
          sometimes used to describe "the Internet."
        </p>
        <blockquote>“I have no idea, maybe black magic.”</blockquote>
        <p>
          This answer sometimes involves hand-waving and anx-ious, slightly
          apologetic faces. To be fair, there are a lot of bad stock images out
          there that support that answer-which is to say, they make the
          mechanisms of the Internet appear impossibly complicated and opaque.
          You may have seen these sorts of images. Sometimes it's a man at the
          peak of an over-Photoshopped mountain, his arms reaching for a giant
          laptop in the sky from which fluffy white clouds emerge. Other times,
          it's a different man (always men in these weird dreamscapes, usually
          wearing ties), hands cradling poorly rendered collages of computers
          and a globe floating in some ethereal mist that could be data
          traveling across the network-or could be fairies, no one really knows.
        </p>

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Ironically, some of these baffling images emerge from attempts to make
          the Internet seem less complicated, through metaphors like "the
          cloud." Metaphors can be useful teaching tools, but when all that
          people know about the Internet are metaphors, it tends to make their
          understanding of it more clouded, not less.

          In our class,

            target="_blank"
            >VIS 208. Graphic Design: Conversations</a
          >, we explored these themes to make sense of the internet. Each week,
          we came together to explore connectivity and creativity across the
          virtual and physical world. We've designed this walk to connect New
          York and Princeton to eachother, the internet, and the rest of the
          world, to help you think about how we "see" the internet. We are all
          still trying to answer, so come along with us to explore the new
          discoveries and connections we have made and hopefully, make your own
          along the way!
