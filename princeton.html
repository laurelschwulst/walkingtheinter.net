            <br /><br />
            To be honest, I never really think too much about how the Internet
            works, which looking back makes me upset that I didn't have that
            curiosity--how could I not want to know? I guess because it's been
            around since before I was born, I take it so much for granted that I
            just never really wonder about it. It's like wondering why birds
            have feathers, or something like that. I never really think of the
            Internet as a physical thing. It's all just those dotted lines
            connecting circles and clouds to me. I had no clue we were walking
            on top of text messages and video calls and transactions and the
            like. It's right beneath us! - Marie

            I am much more aware of the network infrastructure around me. It is
            easy to simply walk past manhole covers and street markings without
            caring as we go about our day-to-day. I would argue that most people
            do this. This book, however, inspires us to ask questions and be
            curious about the things that seem mundane at times as they can be
            really interesting. - Ian

            will take new shapes.' This quote really stuck out to me. It made me

            see a hundred years ago." - Emmie

            The Internet deep deep down is a bunch of cables, and this article
            was a great reminder of what infrastructure is actually needed to
            keep the Internet going. The Internet also seems so disconnected
            from the physical world, but it can suffer from its environment if
            not taken care of properly. For instance, if these cables were not
            underground, they could be impacted by weather and the like, which
            would greatly affect the way we live life. -Anya

            "I thought the discussion about whether it is possible to see the
            internet was very interesting because I hadn’t really thought of the
            internet as a visible physical object. I think one of the
            fascinating things to read about was the meanings behind the various
            symbols/markings that are spray painted on the streets. When I walk
            around the city, I see the spray painted symbols everywhere, yet I
            had never learned about what they mean so it was interesting to read
            about it. I had not realized that the colors of the spray paint also
            held meaning." - Iroha

            "The beginning of Networks of New York where Burrington speaks about
            the veil which seems to cover the technicalities of the internet
            reminded me of how when I was younger I thought that my classmates
            who could code, and were working on things like bread boards or
            raspberry pi (in middle school) were geniuses. In middle school, I
            was watching Youtube and playing Mall World on Facebook...So
            compared to what I was exposed to/knew about, my classmates seemed
            to be do doing things that were worlds away. But, as I learned these
            seemingly impossibly complex things myself, I'd come to realize that
            it's not so exclusive/reserved for the gifted. I think how I felt
            about my classmates projects is how many people might think of the
            internet. There's a thin layer of surface knowledge, and some sort
            of self-doubt that makes people hesitate to want to know more. I
            like the introduction of the internet as something physical (massive
            networks of optic cables) because I think it helps bridge the gap
            that exists for so many people in their understanding of the
            internet. It seems like tangibles are easier to understand than the
            theoretical and/or detached." - Britney

            "I've mostly just considered it as a space online, like a
            remote/imaginary internet land. I've never given any substantial
            thought to the physicality of the internet, and it still weirds me
            out to think about those long undersea internet cables actually
            existing in the ocean... I really liked the underground portion of
            the book, especially the little drawings that would go with it.
            Almost like learning a new language/symbols--it was especially fun
            to look at some of the signs on the field trip too. It was so
            interesting that all the markings on the streets that I previously
            would've simply walk pass were a set of symbols and in some ways
            internet language." - Irene

            templates of our objectives and what questions to ask. However, the
            application of definitions to experimenting on the canvas of the

            "I, probably like most people, was completely unaware of how many of
            these markings were even related to the internet. I thought, for
            example, mancovers were only to access sewer or drainage tunnels.
            With that being said, I have noticed various markings mentioned in
            the text when walking around campus. I always knew internet was
            physical (to a degree), but after reading the text, it is much more
            physical than I realized. Now, however, the internet seems more
            fragile; it seems much more likely that there can be physical
            failures from human causes although I realize one line being
            disrupted does not destroy the whole system." - David

            misinformation is rampant. At the same time, the web is a place
            where various people can connect with one another. I think people
